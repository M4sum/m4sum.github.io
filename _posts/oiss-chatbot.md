# OISS Chatbot

This is a chatbot that allows users to ask immigration questions to their school's OISS website. The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand user questions and provide relevant answers.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this app, you can create and activate a virtual environment using Conda and then run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here are the steps to create and activate a virtual environment using Conda:

1. Install Conda if you haven't already. You can download and install Conda from the following link: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

2. Create a new virtual environment (feel free to change 'oiss-chatbot' to any name you prefer):

   ```
   conda create -n oiss-chatbot
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```
   conda activate oiss-chatbot
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the app, use the following commands:

```
cd src
streamlit run app.py
```

If you face any errors with langchain, try this command:
```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the app and open it in a web browser. You can then ask immigration questions to your school's OISS website and receive answers from the chatbot.

## Configuration

To configure the app, you can create a `.env` file in the root directory of the app and set the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: The API key for the OISS website.
- `API_URL`: The URL for the OISS website API.

You can also customize the HTML templates for the chatbot by editing the files in the `utils/htmlTemplates` directory.
