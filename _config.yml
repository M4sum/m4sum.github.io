  Hi all, I am an AI Research Engineer at Why of AI, currently leading the development of their flagship SaaS product. 
  I also serve as the Chapter Lead of the FruitPunch AI USA chapter and as an Adjunct Lecturer at MSAI Northwestern, 
  where I assist professors in teaching NLP and Deep Learning courses. \n\n
  
  I love building things. I am a student of entrepreneurship and a problem solver at heart, who aims to create AI products for good.
  With over three years of experience as an ML Engineer in the consulting business, I have gained experience developing many AI solutions at various scales.\n\n

  At Deloitte, some prominent projects I worked on include building segment-based demand forecasting software, 
  a scalable pipeline for multi-class classification of fashion products using hierarchical deep networks, 
  and a conversational AI platform for a big pharmaceutical company.\n\n

  With FruitPunch and Cornel's Bioacoustics Lab, my team developed an audio classification pipeline for 25 times faster real-time inference.
  In another project, my team developed a segmentation and label propagation pipeline to estimate the ground area of coral reefs in oceans.\n\n

  I have developed information extraction solutions with multi-modal models, architected customer support QA systems, 
  built a pipeline for predicting adverse drug reactions, a serverless web app for students to collaborate on a yearbook and much more.\n\n

  When my desk gets too dull for me, I often explore music, play basketball, and cook for myself and my loved ones :)
