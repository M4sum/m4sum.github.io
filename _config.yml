  Hi all, I am the Chapter Lead of FruitPunch AI USA chapter and MSAI Northwestern alumni who loves 
  building AI solutions. I am a student of entrepreneurship and a problem solver at heart who aims 
  to create AI products for good. \n\n
  
  With over three years of experience in the domain as an Applied AI engineer and an AI Consultant, 
  I have gained experience developing many AI projects. \n\n
  
  At Deloitte, I built segment-based demand forecasting software, a scalable infrastructure for 
  multi-class classification on hierarchical labels, and a platform for generating firm-specific 
  visuals from text queries. \n\n
  
  With FruitPunch and Cornel's Bioacoustics Lab, my team developed an audio classification pipeline 
  for real-time inference in the Central African rainforest. My contributions sped up inference 
  by a factor of 25. \n\n
  
  I have developed information extraction solution with multi-modal models, architected customer 
  support QA systems, built pipeline for predicting adverse drug reactions and much more, 
  a serverless webapp for students to collaborate on a yearbook, and much more. \n\n
  
  When my desk gets too boring for me, I often explore music, play basketball, 
  and cook for myself and loved ones :)
